# FRCScouting2019ProgramCs
This is a program I made* in first robotics in 2019 for the purpose of scouting matches and robots in robotics competitions.

I did not make this from scratch, though with my current experience in c# I believe I could. 
What I had to do at the time was take the existing program from 2018 and edit most of it to fit 2019.
